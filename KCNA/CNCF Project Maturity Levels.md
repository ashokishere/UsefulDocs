CNCF Project Maturity Levels

Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is the vendor-neutral hub for cloud computing, responsible for hosting, supporting, overseeing,
and directing cloud-native projects. The CNCF aims to make cloud-native computing ubiquitous. Projects within the CNCF are categorized 
into three maturity levels: Sandbox, Incubating, and Graduated.

Project Maturity Levels

Sandbox:

Entry Level: Projects at this stage are in the early phase and are experimental or in proof-of-concept stages.
Purpose: To provide a place for projects to grow and mature.
Criteria: Low barrier for entry, initial idea validation, and community interest.

Incubating:

Intermediate Level: Projects in this phase have shown promise and have begun to gain traction.
Purpose: To further develop the project, increase adoption, and prove sustainability.
Criteria: Adoption by multiple organizations, a healthy rate of changes, external committers from different organizations,
implementation of CNCF’s Code of Conduct, and achieving the Core Infrastructure Initiative best practices badge.

Graduated:

Mature Level: Projects that have crossed the chasm from early adoption to mainstream use.
Purpose: To be fully embraced and widely used in production environments.
Criteria: High adoption rates, proven reliability, security, and performance, as well as a robust community and ecosystem.

Understanding the Chasm

Chasm Concept: The challenge in transitioning a project from early technology adoption (Incubating) to mainstream adoption (Graduated). 
Projects need to demonstrate significant adoption and maturity to cross this gap.

Categories of Users

Innovators: Tech enthusiasts interested in new and exciting projects, often involved in alpha or proof-of-concept stages.
Early Adopters: Organizations or individuals who see potential in a project and are willing to deal with early-stage issues to shape it towards their needs.
Early Majority: Pragmatic users who adopt technology once it has been proven to meet specific requirements, marking the crossing of the chasm.
Late Majority: More risk-averse users who wait until a technology is widely adopted and proven.
Laggards: Skeptical users who adopt technology only when necessary or to avoid being left behind.

Conflict Resolution within CNCF Governance

Discussion: Open discussions in various CNCF calls where perspectives and viewpoints are argued, often leading to agreements or next steps.
Elections and Voting: When discussions do not resolve conflicts, decisions are made through elections and votes, which can be binding or non-binding.
Voting is common in various groups supported by CNCF, with binding votes being the most critical.

Acronyms to Know

TOC (Technical Oversight Committee): Provides oversight, ensuring projects meet CNCF’s standards and criteria for maturity.

SIG (Special Interest Groups): Open groups focusing on specific areas of a project, such as Kubernetes.

TAG (Technical Advisory Group): Provide technical guidance across domains, support new projects, and review transitions from Sandbox to Incubating and beyond.

Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs)

Purpose: Provide technical guidance, support new projects, review project transitions, and coordinate needs within their domain.
Domains: Include storage, security, app delivery, network observability, runtime, and contributor strategy.
By understanding these levels and processes, organizations can better navigate the cloud-native landscape, leveraging the CNCF’s
resources to adopt and contribute to robust, scalable, and secure cloud-native technologies.
