 

What is Auto Scaling?
Auto scaling is a pattern that allows for the automatic scaling of infrastructure or application components according to
metrics or other requirements, enabling the infrastructure to adjust as needed. The term "auto" in auto scaling can mean automatic or automated, 
referring to scaling up, scaling down, and scaling across. Auto scaling is crucial in cloud environments to avoid cost implications from unused resources.

Metrics for Auto Scaling

Common metrics for auto scaling include CPU and memory, but it depends on the application. For example, a service like Netflix might rely
heavily on GPU for video transcoding across various formats and devices.

Types of Auto Scaling Approaches

Reactive Auto Scaling

Triggered when metrics hit a given threshold.
For example, if there's a sudden increase in demand, the system reacts by scaling up.
As demand decreases, the system scales down.
Suitable if the workload can handle the latency of the scaling process.


Scheduled Auto Scaling

Used for predictable increases in workload at specific times.
For example, financial services may schedule scaling for end-of-month batch processing.
Helps avoid the delays of reactive scaling by anticipating demand.

Predictive Auto Scaling

Uses AI and machine learning to predict future demand and scale accordingly.
Learns patterns over time to make informed scaling decisions.
Offers a more dynamic approach compared to reactive and scheduled scaling.

Types of Scaling


Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)

Involves adding resources to existing infrastructure.
More common with virtual machines than physical hardware.
VMware ESXi is an example where resources can be scaled without downtime.

Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)

Involves adding more resources to handle increased demand.
Common in cloud-native environments where resources can be added or removed easily.

Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling

In cloud-native ecosystems, horizontal scaling is emphasized, but both types can be advantageous depending on the application's needs.

Automation and Testing

Automation is crucial for achieving desired outcomes quickly and consistently, leading to cost savings. Testing ensures applications 
can scale and perform as expected, considering complexities like data sharing and concurrency in a distributed compute environment.

Kubernetes and Auto Scaling

Cluster Autoscaler

Adjusts the size of a Kubernetes cluster based on workload. Useful for managing resource utilization and availability.

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

Scales the number of application replicas.

Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)

Scales the resource requests and limits of a pod.

Keda (Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaling)

An event-driven solution that scales objects based on events. Supports scaling to zero, providing significant cost savings.

Conclusion
Auto scaling accelerates application availability and access. Automation should be incorporated for speed and consistency, leading to cost savings. 
Autoscaling acts as an advantage for efficient resource management.
